# Elicitation

> "Elicit: to draw or bring out or forth; educe; evoke." - The Dictionary



Elicitation is a work-in-progress modification for the game Minecraft which is focused on magic. It is being developed purely for the fun of it and work on it may be dropped at any time.

## Development

If you'd like to help with development, please clone this repository and then follow the guidelines given [here](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/topic/13860-tutorial-getting-started-with-forgegradle/#initial_setup) (Initial Setup) to set up the workspace. You may then begin working in your own branch, and when you are ready to merge your changes, you can submit a pull request.


## Installation

If you want to install the latest version of the mod, you can compile it from source by following the steps for [Development](README.md#Development) given above to set up your workspace. You may then navigate to the project directory and run the command `./gradlew build` (Linux), `./gradlew.bat build` (Windows), or `bash gradlew build` (Mac OS X). The compiled .jar file will be placed inside of **project-directory/build/libs**.
